# RepoDemo Solution

## Overview
The `RepoDemo` solution is a demonstration of a clean, modular, and extensible architecture for managing data access, business logic, and API interactions. It leverages modern design patterns such as the **Repository Pattern**, **Specification Pattern**, and **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** to provide a robust and reusable framework for building scalable applications.

This solution is built using **C# 12.0** and targets **.NET 8**.

## Solution Structure
The solution is organized into the following projects:

### 1. RepoDemo.GenericRepository
This project provides a **generic repository pattern** implementation for performing CRUD operations on entities. It is the core of the solution's data access layer and includes:
- **Generic CRUD Operations**: Simplifies data access logic for any entity type.
- **Specification Pattern**: Enables flexible and reusable querying with criteria, includes, sorting, and pagination.
- **Projection Support**: Uses AutoMapper to retrieve entities as DTOs or other projected types.
- **Paging Support**: Fetches paginated results for large datasets.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized exception handling with telemetry tracking.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Fully asynchronous methods for better scalability.

#### Benefits of the Pattern and Structure:
- **Reusability**: The generic repository can be used with any entity type, reducing code duplication.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps data access logic separate from business logic.
- **Flexibility**: The specification pattern allows for complex and dynamic queries without modifying the repository.
- **Testability**: The repository and specifications can be easily mocked for unit testing.
- **Scalability**: Asynchronous operations and paging support make it suitable for handling large datasets.

### 2. RepoDemo.Data
This project serves as the **data layer** of the solution. It includes:
- **Entity Framework Core Integration**: Provides database context and entity configurations.
- **Entity Models**: Defines the database schema and relationships.
- **In-Memory Database Support**: Useful for testing and development.

#### Key Features:
- Centralized management of database interactions.
- Integration with the `RepoDemo.GenericRepository` for data access.

---

### 3. RepoDemo.Service
This project contains the **business logic layer** of the solution. It acts as a bridge between the data layer and the API layer. Key responsibilities include:
- **Service Classes**: Encapsulate business rules and workflows.
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses the `RepoDemo.GenericRepository` to interact with the database.

#### Key Features:
- Promotes a clean separation of business logic from data access and API layers.
- Simplifies testing by isolating business logic.

---

### 4. RepoDemo.DTO
This project defines **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** for structured data exchange between layers. It includes:
- **CustomerDetail**: Represents detailed customer information, including orders and audit metadata.
- **CustomerSummary**: A lightweight representation of customer data.
- **OrderDetail**: Represents order information associated with a customer.

#### Key Features:
- Reduces over-fetching of data by transferring only the required fields.
- Simplifies API responses and improves performance.

---

### 5. RepoDemo.API
This project is the **API layer** of the solution. It provides RESTful endpoints for interacting with the application. Key features include:
- **Swagger Integration**: Automatically generates API documentation using Swashbuckle.
- **Dependency Injection**: Integrates with the `RepoDemo.Service` and `RepoDemo.GenericRepository` projects.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Manages database interactions.

#### Key Features:
- Exposes a clean and well-documented API for clients.
- Supports modern web standards and best practices.

---

### 6. RepoDemo.Common
This project contains **shared utilities and common functionality** used across the solution. It includes:
- **Telemetry Integration**: Tracks exceptions, events, and traces using Application Insights.
- **Helper Classes**: Provides reusable utilities for logging, configuration, etc.

#### Key Features:
- Centralizes common functionality to avoid duplication.
- Enhances observability and diagnostics.
